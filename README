I got frustrated trying to find objects in runtime object models - so I created a utility to do it.

You search for objects using a find utility. Then you can click on the retrieved objects to inspect them

e.g. in the console do this kind of thing

//global search for all properties named home
>>find.props('home');

//search jquery for all properties named map
>>find.props('map', jQuery, 'jQuery')

//global search for all Dates
>>find.instances(Date)

Right now it doesn't work in old fashioned browsers like IE<9
